# Sorting algorithms & Big O notation

## Bubble sort :
Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

**Big O : O(n ^ 2)**

## Insertion sort :
Iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and grows a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.
**Big O : O(n ^ 2)**

## Selection sort :
Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.
**Big O : O(n ^ 2)**

## Quick sort :
A divide-and-conquer algorithm used with **Lomuto scheme partition**. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
**Big O : O(n ^ 2)**

## Counting sort :
Creates a cumul array of the input array integers, then sorts it by reference.
**Big O : O(n + k)**
